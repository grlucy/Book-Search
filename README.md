# Book Search

Deployed at https://books-searcher.herokuapp.com/

## Description

A responsive, single-page MERN app that uses the Google Books API to save and delete books selected by the user to a Mongo database. The app uses socket.io to control save and delete notifications that appear on any browser that is viewing the app, not just the browser where the save/delete action was initiated. The app is styled with the Bulma CSS framework.
